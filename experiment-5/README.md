# Experiment 5 

## Aim
To optimize frontend performance by implementing lazy loading in a React Single Page Application.

## Description
In this experiment, lazy loading was applied to React components so that they are loaded only when required. Routing was implemented using React Router, and components were dynamically imported to improve application performance and reduce initial load time.

## Routes Implemented
- `/` → Home Component  
- `/about` → About Component  
- `/contact` → Contact Component  

## Tools & Technologies
- React
- Vite
- react-router-dom
- JavaScript
- VS Code

## Output
- Navigation bar displayed on the page
- Components load only when their route is accessed
- Smooth navigation without page reload

## Learning Outcome
- Understood lazy loading in React
- Learned performance optimization techniques
- Improved understanding of routing in SPA
