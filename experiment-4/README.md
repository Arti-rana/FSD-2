# Experiment 4

## Aim
To implement and compare different state management techniques in a React application using Local State, Context API, and Redux.

## Description
In this experiment, counters were implemented using three different approaches:
1. Local component state
2. Global state using Context API
3. Global state using Redux

## Implementation Details
- Two counters using **Local State** where each component maintains its own state independently
- Two counters using **Context API** where state is shared globally across components
- Two counters using **Redux** where state is managed centrally using a store

## Tools & Technologies
- React
- Vite
- Context API
- Redux
- JavaScript
- CSS
- VS Code

## Learning Outcome
- Understood differences between local and global state
- Learned implementation of Context API
- Learned Redux state management basics
