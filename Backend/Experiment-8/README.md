# Experiment-8

## Aim
To develop and implement a RESTful API using a backend framework and deploy it on a cloud platform.

---

## Description
In this experiment, a RESTful API was developed using Flask (Python backend framework).  
The API performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.

The backend application was tested using Postman and deployed on Render for public access.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1️⃣ Backend Development
- Flask framework was used to create REST APIs.
- Application structured using routes.
- JSON data format used for request and response handling.
- CRUD operations implemented:
  - Create a new student
  - Retrieve all students
  - Retrieve student by ID
  - Update student data
  - Delete student

### 2️⃣ API Testing using Postman
- GET requests tested to fetch data.
- POST requests tested with JSON body.
- PUT requests used to update records.
- DELETE requests used to remove records.
- Proper status codes verified (200, 201, 404, etc.).

### 3️⃣ Deployment on Render
- Project pushed to GitHub.
- Connected GitHub repository to Render.
- Configured build and start commands.
- API successfully deployed and accessible via public URL.
